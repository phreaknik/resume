        have spent most of my time either tearing apart old gadgets or hacking together new creations of my own.
        This passion for tech exploration and innovation has had a strong impact on my career path.\n\nI studied
        electrical engineering at Texas A&M, where I graduated with a Masters Degree in electrical engineering. In
        school I focused on analog and mixed signal VLSI design, and ultimately spent a few years doing semiconductor
        design. Throughout my time in school and at work in the semiconductor industry, I continued to work on
        personal projects spanning a wide array of technologies, ranging from embedded system design to machine
        learning mathematics.\n\nAfter work, I would often "moonlight" as an independent contractor, helping
        startups prototype their tech ideas and in some cases bring those ideas to production. Now as CTO at Knocki,
        I get to do this every day! I work with a great team of engineers and developers to take wild new ideas off
        the whiteboard and onto the production line."""
